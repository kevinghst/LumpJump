# Poodle Jump

## MVP
Poodle Jump is a clone of doodle jump written in javascript using Canvas and Sprites.

The poodle consistently jumps upward by itself, while the user controls the horizontal direction of the jump. With the user's control, the poodle rises to higher heights by jumping on platforms. The higher the poodle goes, the higher the user's score. The player loses when the poodle falls to the bottom of the screen without being able to touch on any pad.
